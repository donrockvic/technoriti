          <h3>JUDGING CRITERIA</h3>
         	<p>
            <ol start="1">
            <li>A robot is declared victorious if its opponent is immobilized.
</li><li>	A robot will be declared immobile if it cannot display linear motion of at least one inch in a timed period of 30 seconds. A robot with one side of its drive train disabled will not be counted out if it can demonstrate some degree of controlled movement. In case both the robots remain mobile after the end of the round then the winner will be decided subjectively.
</li><li>	A robot that is deemed unsafe by the judges after the match has begun will be disqualified and therefore declared the loser. The match will be immediately halted and the opponent will be awarded a win.
</li><li>	If a robot is thrown out of the arena the match will stop immediately, and the robot still inside the arena will automatically be declared as the winner.
</li><li>	If the robots become entangled with each other, the robots should be taken back to initial positions and then the match will continue.</li></ol></p><p>
NOTE : Qualification of a robot to next level is subjective and totally on the decision of the judges. A robot winning in a round against an opponent doesn’t guarantee its entrance into the next round. If the judges find the winner robot incompetent to enter into the next round, it may get disqualified. Judges can disqualify both the robots of a match from advancing to next round. All the decisions taken by the judge will be final and binding to all. Any queries afterwards will not be entertained
